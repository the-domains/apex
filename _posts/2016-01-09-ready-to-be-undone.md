# Ready to be Undone?

When you begin to **AWAKEN** to areas of your life that you have been deceived in, what begins to happen is a time of **UNDOING** that cannot be controled or handled.  What's left over in life is sometimes a wake of hurt, undone areas of life, confusion, even emptiness.  This is not UN-Normal...in every man's journey this undoing is a time of pruning, that if navigated right, can take you to the next adventure and dream that you were destined and designed to accomplish.  We must be undone for the next season to take place.  You cannot do this alone only with other men, on the same journey, on the same mission, at the same point of life, can you reach your next_Apex_!
