# Defeat the Dragon Part 2

Welcome back. I applaud you. The famous line in Alcoholics Anonymous is the first step to solving the problem is admitting you have a problem.

Fear is a problem.

Fear wants to destroy your life, your dream, your creativity. Like I wrote in the last post, fear is like a 10 foot dragon which wants to consume your dream....your creativity.

## We have 2 ways to conquer the dragon

1\. Keep moving forward - take a step.

2\. Choose a word - Word of the Year project.

Today I'm going to share with you how you start your Word of the Year project. How do you choose a word?

First, let me encourage you, there truly is no wrong way to choose a word. Some people know immediately what their word is supposed to be - freedom, attack, open, breakthrough. Other people struggle with what it is they are to focus on.

These 5 steps are meant for you if you are struggling to choose a word.

_1\. Ask._

I am a Believer. I believe in a God who speaks to me, and who wants to speak to you. I realize not everyone believes this, so who you ask is up to you. You might ask God, nature, yourself or even a close friend, but ask for guidance on what word you should focus on in 2016\.

_2\. Wait._

Once you ask (God or someone else), take a moment. It could be an hour, a day or even a week. But wait to see what words come to you.

You don't want to rush this step. You are going to spend a full year with your word, so make sure it's the one you really want and need.

_3\. Listen._

This is a good time to brainstorm or write a list of potential words you would like to see happen in your life. Again, as a Believer, I take this as a step to listen for what God might want to share with me.

However, this doesn't come without taking step 1 and step 2 first. Ask, Wait, Listen.

> Ask, Wait, Listen.

_4\. Believe._

Eventually, you are going to land on a word. When you have it, take a leap of faith, and believe it's the one for you. Believe it is the first step to defeating fear in your life.

One way to express your belief is tell people in your world what your Word of the Year is. Tell a friend, share in a blog, post a picture on Instagram or write something on Facebook. If nothing else, write a quick comment on this blog. Share your word, and you'll begin to believe.

_5\. Act._

This is actually the most critical step of the entire process. Choosing a word alone is worthless. You will truly learn, grow and defeat fear by actively working to hear what your Word is speaking to you.

There are a ton of ways you can make acting on your word practical. Next week, I will share with you 5-6 ideas on how you can act on your word.

Until then, keep walking.
