# How to Conquer the Dragon.

Growing up I believed there were two type of people - creative and non-creative. I fell in the non-creative category. I believed this theory well into my 30's. At some point, though, it dawned on me that everyone is creative. We simply create in different and unique ways.

Don't ask me to draw a picture, paint a painting or sculpt anything. However, give me a few minutes, an audience and a microphone, and I have a chance. Better yet, give me an organization and a team, and I can create with the best of them. I am creative, and so are you.

As creatives, fear is our biggest enemy. In his book, Do the Work, Steven Pressfield refers to fear as the Resistance. He compares fear to a 10 foot dragon fighting our call to create.

> Fear is a Dragon that wants to destroy your dream.

As creatives, it's our job to determine how to overcome the dragon. When we do, we are free to design and build what's in our head and heart.

How do you overcome fear? There lots answers this question, but I've found 2 ways that never lack results.

## Take a Step.

Most times my fear is triggered by focusing on the wrong thing. It comes by looking at the end goal, the big picture or the final result rather than the next step. Here's the kicker, the end goal always seems insurmountable, but the next step is equally simple and easy.

When I just focus on the next step, and I take that step, the following step becomes clear. While I still am headed toward my end goal, it's not nearly so daunting. Best of all, my fear is neutralized.

Today, if you find yourself paralyzed by fear, I encourage to think about the next thing you know you need to do. Then do it.

After you finish that thing, find the next thing, and do it. Repeat, wash, rinse. Eventually, you'll find yourself at your goal!

## Pick a Word

One reason we fear is because we have no clue how to get where we know we want to go.

At the end of 2010, I was stuck. I was stuck in business, relationships, family and finances. I was more that stuck...I was in virtual chains. Worst of all, I had no idea how to get out. I knew freedom was possible, but I was clueless on how to get there. In January of 2011, my wife told me about a project her and a friend were beginning - Word of the Year. They chose one word they wanted to see happen or become a part of their life. Then she said she was going to focus on her word for the entire year. I thought this sounded interesting, and that alone was unusual. My normal response is to ignore these types of ideas from my wife.

So I chose a word, focused and journaled about it. I repeated this same project the following year and then again. This year, I began my 6th Word of the Year project. My life hasn't been the same.

One reason I love this project is it helps develop a picture of how to get where I want to go.

_Over the next couple of weeks, I'm going to share with you how you can defeat fear by participating in a Word of the Year project. I'll share with you how to choose a word, what to do when you've chosen your word, and how to keep the momentum going throughout the year._

**The question is, "Will you do the work?"**
