# I have a love of water; I would also tell you I have a fear of water. 

## Allow me to explain. 

Do you remember as a kid what it felt like to jump into the deep end of the pool? Maybe you are like me and would try and talk yourself out of it? That is what we tend to do when faced with a fear or doubt. But, what if jumping in the deep end meant you could go on an incredible journey into new territory. Forget about the rush that you feel once you're in the deep end. Once under water, your able to see the sun dance on the water in new ways you could never see while on top of the water. What if at that moment you could just relax, breath, and silence yourself? What would come up in that internal conversation and would that conversation allow you to shift how you might be showing up in life? How might you be showing up in your business or your relationships? Sometimes the killer of relationships isn't a lack of trust, a lack of communication or arguing with your significant other. It's pure indifference. We go into "autopilot" mode and become indifferent toward one another or even our current position in life. 

I have sat in this struggle many times in my life. What I have learned by sitting in this process is that the soul usually knows what to do to heal itself. The challenge is to silence the mind. Part of the process of progress is the struggle; it is the fear. That's why it is important to align yourself with those on the same mission as you. I have a close friend maybe more like a mentor and he has said to me on more than one occasion "Kick at indifference unitil it bleeds life."

I recognize when fear paralyzes me, it is a good sign._Fear is an indicator that I am on the right path_. Fear tempts to me get stuck in a proverbial rut. The dirty little secret no one talks about is that we tend to be motivated by fear, and everyone is making it up as they go along. 

## Fear tells us what we need to do next.
