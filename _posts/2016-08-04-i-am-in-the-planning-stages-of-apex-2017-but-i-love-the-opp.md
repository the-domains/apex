Meet [Jose Gonzalez][0], he is a creative entrepreneur and photographer but before that he served in Afghanistan in our US Armed Forces. Julia and I have gotten to know Jose and his wife/business partner [Teresa][1] over the last couple of years. To say they have not had struggles would be an understatement, but who hasn't. It is in those struggles that I have seen a commitment to transformation. As of now, I experience him to "Show Up" in life and be present with himself and family. I have watched him kick at indifference until it bleeds life. He is opening up possibilities and creating hope for others by using his gifts. This last month he is documenting a medical missions trip for a community of faith in India. He visited a leper colony, multiple schools that are providing medical care for children 1st to 5th grade, and visited villages where women were given loans to start their own businesses. This image he sent me this morning sums up his feelings.
