            <title><![CDATA[The vision behind Apex is just more than just a photography workshop. It is an opportunity for men to come together and open up possibilities while making lifetime friendships with other men. I have a firm belief that a life worth living is when you align yourself with those on the same mission as you. I hope this will create a space to for you to see what is wanted and needed in your life to be a better father, husband, business owner, and dreamer. I want to help come alongside of you and take you to your vision. ]]></title>
