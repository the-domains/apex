            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Importance of Changing Mediums</h1><h2>Why We Need More Polymaths in the 21st Century...by Jeff Goins</h2><p>My grandfather, the painter, loved Picasso. In his house were abstract oil paintings, attempts at mimicking the master. Because of these paintings, I always assumed Picasso just painted things a little weirdly. But that wasn’t the case at all.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b999c2d8afd8810b61d1cfdf5ccb6a4dd1de9216.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Moving Forward-The APEX Mandate]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Moving Forward-The APEX Mandate</h1><p>Do you remember as a kid what it felt like to jump into the deep end of the pool? Maybe you are like me and would try and talk yourself out of it? That is what we tend to do when faced with a fear or doubt. But, what if jumping in the deep end meant you could go on an incredible journey into new territory. Forget about the rush that you feel once you're in the deep end. Once under water, your able to see the sun dance on the water in new ways you could never see while on top of the water. What if at that moment you could just relax, breath, silence yourself and take it all in? What would come up in that internal conversation and would that conversation allow you to shift how you might be showing up in life? How might you be showing up in your business or your relationships? Sometimes the killer of relationships isn’t a lack of trust, a lack of communication or arguing with your significant other. It’s pure indifference. We go into “autopilot” mode and become indifferent toward one another or even our current position in life.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ready to be Undone?</h1><p>When you begin to AWAKEN to areas of your life that you have been deceived in, what begins to happen is a time of UNDOING that cannot be controled or handled.  What's left over in life is sometimes a wake of hurt, undone areas of life, confusion, even emptiness.  This is not UN-Normal…in every man's journey this undoing is a time of pruning, that if navigated right, can take you to the next adventure and dream that you were destined and designed to accomplish.  We must be undone for the next season to take place.  You cannot do this alone only with other men, on the same journey, on the same mission, at the same point of life, can you reach your next Apex! </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b63fc8c5a78596a27d61ea040f47449cec9631b5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
