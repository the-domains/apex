Maybe you are like me and would try and talk yourself out of it? That is what we tend to do when faced with a fear or doubt. But, what if jumping in the deep end meant you could go on an incredible journey into new territory. Forget about the rush that you feel once you're in the deep end. Once under water, your able to see the sun dance on the water in new ways you could never see while on top of the water. What if at that moment you could just relax, breath, silence yourself and take it all in? What would come up in that internal conversation and would that conversation allow you to shift how you might be showing up in life? How might you be showing up in your business or your relationships? Sometimes the killer of relationships isn’t a lack of trust, a lack of communication or arguing with your significant other. It’s pure indifference. We go into “autopilot” mode and become indifferent toward one another or even our current position in life.

What I have learned by sitting in this process is that the soul usually knows what to do to heal itself. The challenge is to silence the mind. Part of the process of progress is the struggle; it is the fear. That's why it is important to align yourself with those on the same mission as you. I have a close friend maybe more like a mentor and he has said to me on more than one occasion "Kick at indifference until it bleeds life."</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="100"><blockquote><p>Kick at indifference until it bleeds life - Dan Tocchini</p></blockquote></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="101"><p>A good story is one that has a character that is faced with conflict, facing fear or struggle and must dig deep to find resolve.

There are various aspects of my life that demanded that I be a leader in some capacity, and others where I have chosen it. <b>My father died</b><b> when I was 15</b>, and as
    the oldest of 4 kids many people started me that I was the ‘<i>Man of house</i>’ and that I needed to not only be a leader for my siblings, but strong for my mom. I took this as seriously as anyone that age probably could have, and there where times
    where I both lived up to, and fell short of that demand. I attended Columbia College in Chicago for photography, and dropped out after my third year based on the decision that more debt would hinder my travel dreams and ability to keep living costs
    low when I wanted to become self employed. In 2013 I started my own business, and became fully financially dependent on it within a year. That same year I also purchased my first home, followed by getting married in 2014. Through all of these phases
    of life, there are a few constant things I have observed about leading that I really believe will carry me forward.</p><h2>Big Picture Focus</h2><p>Lead for the long haul. As you take on projects, jobs, or personal life responsibilities, don’t get so wrapped up in the immediate that you lose sight of your long term goals. Just as a good architect wouldn’t put together a bunch or random rooms to see
    if it functioned as a house, you need to approach everything from a standpoint of how it fits into your long term goals and values. As a leader this sometimes just means saying no to a project, even if you feel guilty for doing so. It can also mean
    trusting and empowering someone else to manage and take ownership of a task so you can focus on other things. There will always be some projects or responsibilities that are required of us that seem to make no sense at all. When I am in these moments
    I try and learn whatever I can from them so that my other areas can at least be strengthened through what I experienced.</p><blockquote>
    <p>The most rewarding moments in my life have been when I have let go, and just enabled the people around me with my best energy and commitment.</p>

Maybe you are like me and would try and talk yourself out of it? That is what we tend to do when faced with a fear or doubt. But, what if jumping in the deep end meant you could go on an incredible journey into new territory. Forget about the rush that you feel once you're in the deep end. Once under water, your able to see the sun dance on the water in new ways you could never see while on top of the water. What if at that moment you could just relax, breath, silence yourself and take it all in? What would come up in that internal conversation and would that conversation allow you to shift how you might be showing up in life? How might you be showing up in your business or your relationships? Sometimes the killer of relationships isn’t a lack of trust, a lack of communication or arguing with your significant other. It’s pure indifference.
